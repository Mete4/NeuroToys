# NeuroToys: Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interface for Real-Time Robot Control
## Project Overview
NeuroToys is a senior capstone project aimed at developing a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows users to control a robotic device in real-time using EEG signals. The system interprets brainwave patterns to translate them into commands for robot movement, improving accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities. This project combines expertise in mechanical design, electrical engineering, and machine learning.
